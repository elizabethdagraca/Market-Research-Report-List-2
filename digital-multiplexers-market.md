<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Multiplexers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Synchronous TDM</li><li>Anynchronous TDM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Digital multiplexers are devices used to combine multiple data streams into a single high-speed output. There are two main types of digital multiplexers in the market - Synchronous TDM and Asynchronous TDM. Synchronous TDM requires all input signals to be synchronized to a common clock signal, ensuring data is transferred at the same rate. On the other hand, Asynchronous TDM allows input signals to be transmitted independently of each other, resulting in more flexible data transfer. Both types of digital multiplexers serve different purposes and cater to different requirements in the telecommunications industry.</p></p>
