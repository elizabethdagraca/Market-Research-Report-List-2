<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Machine Room Less Elevator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Traction</li><li>Hydraulic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Machine Room Less (MRL) Elevators come in two main types: Traction and Hydraulic. Traction MRL elevators are driven by ropes and counterweights, allowing for smooth and efficient vertical transportation in buildings of various heights. Hydraulic MRL elevators, on the other hand, use a hydraulic system to move the cab up and down. Traction MRL elevators are generally preferred for taller buildings, while hydraulic MRL elevators are suitable for buildings with fewer floors and lower traffic demands. Both types offer space-saving benefits due to their machine room-less design.</p></p>
