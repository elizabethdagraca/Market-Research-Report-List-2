<p><strong>The Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy HBOT Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Infection Treatment</li><li>Gas Embolism</li><li>CO Poisoning</li><li>Hypoxic Encephalopathy</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) is used for various medical conditions such as infection treatment, gas embolism, carbon monoxide poisoning, hypoxic encephalopathy, and other conditions. Infection treatment involves using high levels of oxygen to kill bacteria and promote healing. Gas embolism occurs when air bubbles enter the bloodstream, and HBOT helps to reduce their size and alleviate symptoms. HBOT is also effective in treating carbon monoxide poisoning by increasing oxygen levels in the blood. Additionally, it can help improve oxygen delivery to the brain in cases of hypoxic encephalopathy and other conditions.</p></p>
