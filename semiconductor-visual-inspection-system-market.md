<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Visual Inspection System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automatic</li><li>Fully Automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Semiconductor Visual Inspection System market consists of two main types: Semi-automatic and Fully Automatic systems. Semi-automatic systems require human intervention for loading and unloading of the components to be inspected, while the inspection process itself is automated. On the other hand, Fully Automatic systems perform the inspection process without any human intervention, from loading to inspecting and unloading. Both types offer high precision and efficiency in detecting defects in semiconductor components, but Fully Automatic systems are typically preferred for large-scale and high-volume productions due to their higher level of automation.</p></p>
