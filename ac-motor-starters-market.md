<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC Motor Starters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reduced Voltage AC Starters</li><li>Full Voltage AC Motor Starters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Reduced Voltage AC Starters are used to gradually increase the voltage supplied to an AC motor in order to reduce the inrush current and torque during startup, thus minimizing mechanical and electrical stress on the motor. On the other hand, Full Voltage AC Motor Starters provide a full voltage supply to the motor from the beginning, resulting in a higher inrush current and torque. Both types of starters are used in various industrial applications to control the starting and stopping of AC motors efficiently.</p></p>
