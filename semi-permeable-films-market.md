<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semi Permeable Films Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biomembrane</li><li>Synthetic Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Semi-permeable films are categorized into two main types: Biomembrane and Synthetic Membrane. Biomembranes are natural barriers made up of biological molecules that control the passage of substances, such as proteins and lipids. Synthetic membranes, on the other hand, are man-made materials designed to mimic the functions of biomembranes. They are commonly used in various industries such as healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and water treatment due to their selective permeability properties. Both types of semi-permeable films play crucial roles in controlling the diffusion of substances.</p></p>
