<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Interface Units (HIU) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect HIU</li><li>Direct HIU</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heat Interface Units (HIU) can be divided into two main types: Indirect HIU and Direct HIU. Indirect HIUs use a plate heat exchanger to transfer heat from a central heating network to a domestic hot water supply, while Direct HIUs use a coil that is directly connected to both the central heating system and the domestic hot water supply. Both types of HIUs offer efficient heat transfer within buildings, but Indirect HIUs are often preferred for larger residential or commercial buildings due to their ability to handle higher flow rates.</p></p>
