<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion FPDs</li><li>Direct Conversion FPDs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flat Panel Detectors (FPDs) can be categorized into two main types: indirect conversion FPDs and direct conversion FPDs. Indirect conversion FPDs use a scintillator material to convert X-ray photons into light, which is then converted into an electrical signal by a photodiode. On the other hand, direct conversion FPDs directly convert X-ray photons into electrical signals using a semiconductor material such as amorphous selenium. Each type of FPD has its own advantages and limitations, and their market share can vary depending on specific application requirements.</p></p>
