<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soil Moisture Probes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capacitance Type</li><li>Resistor Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Soil moisture probes come in two main types: capacitance type and resistor type. Capacitance type probes measure soil moisture by detecting changes in electrical capacitance caused by water content. These probes are often more accurate and durable, making them preferred for agricultural and research applications. Resistor type probes, on the other hand, measure soil moisture based on changes in electrical resistance. They are typically more affordable and easier to install, making them a popular choice for home gardening and landscaping.</p></p>
