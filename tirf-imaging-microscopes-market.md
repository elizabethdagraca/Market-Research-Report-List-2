<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TIRF Imaging Microscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Prism Type</li><li>Objective Len Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>TIRF imaging microscopes are available in two main types based on the method of generating evanescent waves: Prism type and Objective Lens type. Prism type TIRF systems use a prism to direct the excitation laser beam at a specific angle, creating an evanescent wave at the interface of the sample. Objective Lens type TIRF systems use a high numerical aperture objective lens to generate the evanescent wave directly above the sample surface. Both types offer unique advantages and are chosen based on specific experimental requirements in the research field.</p></p>
