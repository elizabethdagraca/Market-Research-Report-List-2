<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hernia Surgical Mesh Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Absorbable Mesh Implants</li><li>Absorbable Mesh Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hernia surgical mesh implants come in two main types: non-absorbable and absorbable. Non-absorbable mesh implants are made of synthetic materials like polypropylene and provide long-term support to the weakened tissue. Absorbable mesh implants, on the other hand, are designed to break down and be absorbed by the body over time, eventually leaving behind only the patient's own tissue. Both types of mesh implants are used in hernia repair surgeries to provide reinforcement and prevent the hernia from recurring.</p></p>
