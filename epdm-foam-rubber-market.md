<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EPDM Foam Rubber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Cell Rubber</li><li>Semi-closed Cell Rubber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Closed cell rubber is a type of EPDM foam rubber with sealed cells that do not allow air or liquids to pass through, making it highly resistant to moisture and water absorption. Semi-closed cell rubber, on the other hand, has cells that are not completely sealed, allowing for some air and liquid permeability. Both types are commonly used in various applications such as gaskets, seals, insulation, and cushioning due to their excellent weather resistance, durability, and thermal insulation properties.</p></p>
