<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-photon CLSM</li><li>Multiphoton CLSM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM) market includes two main types: Single-photon CLSM and Multiphoton CLSM. Single-photon CLSM uses a single photon to excite the specimen and create an image, which is ideal for thin samples with high fluorescence intensity. On the other hand, Multiphoton CLSM uses two photons to excite the sample, allowing for deeper penetration and reduced photobleaching and phototoxicity, making it suitable for thick samples or live cell imaging. Both types cater to different research needs and applications in the scientific community.</p></p>
