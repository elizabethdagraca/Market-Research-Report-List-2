<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Melt Pressure Transducers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>NaK Filled Melt Pressure Transducers</li><li>Oil Filled Melt Pressure Transducers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Melt pressure transducers are used in the plastics and rubber industries to measure pressure in high-temperature environments. Two common types are NaK filled melt pressure transducers and oil-filled melt pressure transducers. NaK filled transducers utilize a eutectic mixture of sodium and potassium to transmit pressure readings, while oil-filled transducers use an oil-based fluid. NaK filled transducers are preferred for their excellent performance at high temperatures, while oil-filled transducers are typically more cost-effective and offer reliable performance. Both types cater to the specific needs of different industries within the market.</p></p>
