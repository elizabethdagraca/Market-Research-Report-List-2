<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Icynene Spray Foam Insulation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Cell Foam</li><li>Closed Cell Foam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Icynene Spray Foam Insulation is available in two main types: Open Cell Foam and Closed Cell Foam. Open Cell Foam is less dense and has a lower R-value, making it a more cost-effective option for insulation. Closed Cell Foam, on the other hand, is more dense and has a higher R-value, providing better insulation properties and strength. Both types offer energy efficiency and air sealing benefits, but Closed Cell Foam is generally preferred for areas that require higher moisture resistance and structural support.</p></p>
